## About the project
The program was a project to be done as part of the course "Become a front-end web developer" at Udacity.

A starter code of the HTML and CSS files was provided as well as a very short JavaScript document with some specifications. With the starter code, one could not play. I had to make it work properly.

## Credits
The JavaScript code was developed by Hugo Tiburtino.
The most of the CSS and the HTML codes was provided by Udacity.
I would like to thank you Eman Mohammed A. for valuable tips on the code
